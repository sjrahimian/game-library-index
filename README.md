# Game Library Scout

## Introduction

Game Library Scout is a basic, bare-bones directory for your digital collection. It synchronizes with your Steam and GOG libraries to identify cross-store duplicates, reveal platform compatibility, and provide a unified index of your basic gaming metadata.

## Development Setup

After cloning the repository, or downloading via ZIP.

```bash
cd game-library-tracker/
npm install
npm start
```
